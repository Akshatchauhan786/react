                In Short: We retain your information for the necessary duration
                for the purposes mentioned in this privacy policy unless a
                longer retention period for information is legally required.
              </p>
              <p>
                We will retain your personal data only for as long as necessary
                to achieve the purposes outlined in this privacy policy, unless
                a longer retention period is mandated or permitted by law (such
                as tax, accounting, or other legal purposes). No purpose
                outlined in this policy will require us to retain your personal
                data for longer than the period during which you maintain an
                account with us.
              </p>

                has been stored in backup archives), we will securely store your
                personal information and isolate it from further processing
                until deletion is possible.

                transmission over the Internet or information storage technology
                can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Therefore, we cannot
                guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorized
                third parties will not be able to breach our security and
                improperly access, steal, or modify your data. Although we do
                our utmost to protect your personal information, the
                transmission of data to and from our Services is at your own
                risk. You should access and use our Services only within a
                secure environment.

                delete such information from our records. If you become aware of

              <h3>10. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</h3>
              <p>
                Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and
                applications include a Do-Not-Track (“DNT”) feature or setting
                you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have
                data about your online browsing activities monitored and
                collected. As of now, there is no uniform technology or standard
                to identify and implement DNT signals. Therefore, as of now, we
                do not respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism
                that automatically communicates your choice of “Do Not Track”
                online. Should a standard for online tracking be adopted that we
                must follow in the future, we will inform you about that
                practice in an updated version of this privacy policy.
              </p>
              <p>
                California law mandates us to let you know how we handle web
                browser DNT signals. Since there is currently no industry or
                legal standard to recognize or honor DNT signals, we do not
                respond to them at this time.

                Under certain US state data protection laws, you can appoint an
                authorized agent to make a request on your behalf. We may deny a
                request from an authorized agent who does not provide proof that
                they have been validly authorized to act on your behalf, in
                accordance with applicable laws.
              </p>

              <h4>Request Verification</h4>
              <p>
                Upon receiving your request, we may need to verify your identity
                to confirm that you are the individual whose information is in
                our system. We will use personal information provided in your
                request solely to verify your identity or authority to make the
                request. If we cannot verify your identity with the information
                we already maintain, we may ask you to provide additional
                information for verification purposes and for security or fraud
                prevention.
              </p>
              <p>
                If a request is submitted by an authorized agent, we may require
                additional information to verify your identity. The agent must
                provide written and signed permission from you, authorizing them
                to submit the request on your behalf.
              </p>

                take action regarding your request, you may appeal our decision
                by emailing us at{" "}
