                2.4 Reservation of Rights. Nothing in this Agreement grants any
                right, title, or interest in or to (including any license under)
                any Intellectual Property Rights in or relating to, the
                Services, Provider Materials, or Third-Party Materials, whether
                expressly, by implication, estoppel, or otherwise. All right,
                title, and interest in and to the Services, the Provider
                Materials, and the Third-Party Materials are and will remain
                with Provider and the respective rights holders in the

              </p>

              <p>
                2.5 Service Management. Each party shall, throughout the Term,
                maintain within its organization a service manager to serve as
                such party's primary point of contact for day-to-day
                communications, consultation, and decision-making regarding this
                Agreement. Each service manager shall be responsible for
                providing all day-to-day consents and approvals on behalf of
                such party under this Agreement. Each party shall ensure its
                service manager has the requisite organizational authority,
                skill, experience, and other qualifications to perform in such
                capacity. The Customer's initial service manager(s) are its
                Administrator(s) listed on the initial Order Form. Each party
                shall use commercially reasonable efforts to maintain the same
                service manager in place throughout the Term. If either party's
                service manager ceases to be employed by such party or such
                party otherwise wishes to replace its service manager, such
                party shall promptly name a new service manager by written
                notice to the other party.
              </p>

              <p>
                2.6 Changes. Provider reserves the right, in its sole
                discretion, to make any changes to the Services and Provider
                Materials that it deems necessary or useful to: (a) maintain or
                enhance: (i) the quality or delivery of Provider's services to
                its customers; (ii) the competitive strength of or market for
                Provider's services; or (iii) the Services' cost efficiency or
                performance; or (b) to comply with applicable Law.&nbsp;
              </p>

              <p>
                2.7 Subcontractors. Provider may from time to time in its
                discretion engage third parties to perform Services (each, a
                "Subcontractor"). Provider will assume responsibility for the
                acts, errors, and omissions of all such subcontractors to the
                same extent it assumes liability for its own performance of the
                Services under this Agreement.
              </p>

              <p>
                2.8 Suspension or Termination of Services. Provider may,
                directly or indirectly, and by use of a Provider Disabling
                Device or any other lawful means, suspend, terminate, or
                otherwise deny Customer's, any Authorized User's, or any other
                Person's access to or use of all or any part of the Services or
                Provider Materials, without incurring any resulting obligation
                or liability, if: (a) Provider receives a judicial or other
                governmental demand or order, subpoena, or law enforcement
                request that expressly or by reasonable implication requires
                Provider to do so; or (b) Provider believes, in its good faith
                and reasonable discretion, that: (i) Customer or any Authorized
                User has failed to comply with any term of this Agreement, or
                accessed or used the Services beyond the scope of the rights
                granted or for a purpose not authorized under this Agreement or
                in any manner that does not comply with any instruction or
                requirement of the Documentation and Content; (ii) Customer or
                any Authorized User is, has been, or is likely to be involved in
                any fraudulent, misleading, or unlawful activities relating to
                or in connection with any of the Services; or (iii) this
                Agreement expires or is terminated. This Section 2.8 does not
                limit any of Provider's other rights or remedies, whether at
                law, in equity, or under this Agreement.
              </p>

              <p>
                2.9 Service Support. The Services include Provider's standard
                customer support services ("Support Services") in accordance
                with the Provider's standard service support schedule then in
                effect. Provider may amend the support schedule from time to
                time in its sole discretion. Customer may purchase enhanced
                support services separately at Provider's then current rates.

              </p>

              <p>4 Customer Obligations.</p>

              <p>
                4.1 Customer Systems and Cooperation. Customer shall at all
                times during the Term: (a) set up, maintain, and operate in good
                repair and in accordance with the Documentation all Customer
                Systems on or through which the Services are accessed or used;
                (b) provide Provider Personnel with such access to Customer's
                premises and Customer Systems as is necessary for Provider to
                perform the Services in accordance with the Documentation; and
                (c) provide all cooperation and assistance as Provider may
                reasonably request to enable Provider to exercise its rights and
                perform its obligations under and in connection with this
                Agreement. As the owner, the client must promptly approve
                updates for the app on the Apple App Store and Google Play
                Store, as well as accept updates to developer accounts, upon
                request. Additionally, the client is required to add Pocketnest
                and Budzet developer(s) to their development accounts with the
                ability to submit and release the Pocketnest and Budzet app. The
                client is also responsible for paying the standard app store
                annual renewal fees. Failure to adhere to these requirements may
                result in limited functionality or cessation of app
                functionality, leading to a compromised user experience. In such
                cases, the client agrees that regular monthly fees will continue
                to be charged."
              </p>
            
              <p>
                4.2 Effect of Customer Failure or Delay. Provider is not
                responsible or liable for any delay or failure of performance
                caused in whole or in part by Customer's delay in performing, or
                failure to perform, any of its obligations under this Agreement
                (each, a "Customer Failure").&nbsp;
              </p>

              <p>
                4.3 Corrective Action and Notice. If Customer becomes aware of
                any actual or threatened activity prohibited by Section 3.1,
                Customer shall, and shall cause its Authorized Users to,
                immediately: (a) take all reasonable and lawful measures within
                their respective control that are necessary to stop the activity
                or threatened activity and to mitigate its effects (including,
                where applicable, by discontinuing and preventing any
                unauthorized access to the Services and Provider Materials and
                permanently erasing from their systems and destroying any data
                to which any of them have gained unauthorized access); and (b)
                notify Provider of any such actual or threatened activity.&nbsp;
              </p>

              <p>
                4.4 Non-Solicitation. During the Term and for two (2) years
                after, Customer and Provider agrees not to and shall not assist
                any other Person to, directly or indirectly recruit or solicit
                (other than by general advertisement not directed specifically
                to any Person or Persons) for employment or engagement as an
                independent contractor any Person then or within the prior
                twelve (12) months employed or engaged by the other party and
                involved in any respect with the Services or the performance of
                this Agreement. In the event of a violation of this Section 4.4,

                b) except as may be permitted by and subject to its compliance
                with Section 8.4, not disclose or permit access to Confidential
                Information other than to its Representatives who: (i) need to

                access, or disclosure using at least the degree of care it uses
                to protect its similarly sensitive information and in no event
                less than a reasonable degree of care;&nbsp;
              </p>

              <p>
                d) promptly notify the Disclosing Party of any unauthorized use
                or disclosure of Confidential Information and cooperate with
                Disclosing Party to prevent further unauthorized use or
                disclosure; and&nbsp;

              </p>

              <p>
                f) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement, the
                Receiving Party's obligations under this Section 8 with respect
                to any Confidential Information that constitutes a trade secret
                under any applicable Law will continue until such time, if ever,
                as such Confidential Information ceases to qualify for trade
                secret protection under one or more such applicable Laws other
                than as a result of any act or omission of the Receiving Party
                or any of its Representatives. Likewise, the Receiving Party's
                obligations under this Section 8 with respect to any Authorized
                User data shall continue until such time, if ever, as it is no
                longer confidential in nature.
              </p>
              
              

              <p>

                Representatives is compelled by applicable Law to disclose any
                Confidential Information then, to the extent permitted by
                applicable Law, the Receiving Party shall: (a) promptly, and
                prior to such disclosure, notify the Disclosing Party in writing
                of such requirement so that the Disclosing Party can seek a
                protective order or other remedy or waive its rights under
                Section 8.3; and (b) provide reasonable assistance to the
                Disclosing Party, at the Disclosing Party's sole cost and
                expense, in opposing such disclosure or seeking a protective
                order or other limitations on disclosure. If the Disclosing
                Party waives compliance or, after providing the notice and
                assistance required under this Section 8.4, the Receiving Party
                remains required by Law to disclose any Confidential
                Information, the Receiving Party shall disclose only that
                portion of the Confidential Information that, on the advice of
                the Receiving Party's outside legal counsel, the Receiving Party
                is legally required to disclose and, on the Disclosing Party's
                request, shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain
                assurances from the applicable court or other presiding
                authority that such Confidential Information will be afforded
                confidential treatment.

                on behalf of Provider; or (ii) with Provider's written approval
                in accordance with Provider's written specification;
              </p>

              <p>
                d) failure to timely implement any modifications, upgrades,

                e) act, omission, or other matter described in Section 11.2(a),
                Section 11.2(b), Section 11.2(c), or Section 11.2(d), whether or

              <p>

                "Provider Indemnitee") from and against any and all Losses
                incurred by such Provider Indemnitee resulting from any Action
                by a third party (other than an Affiliate of a Provider
                Indemnitee) to the extent that such Losses arise out of or
                result from, or are alleged to arise out of or result
                from:&nbsp;
              </p>

              </p>

              <p>
                b) any other materials or information (including any documents,
                data, specifications, software, content, or technology) provided
                by or on behalf of Customer or any Authorized User, including
                Provider's compliance with any specifications or directions
                provided by or on behalf of Customer or any Authorized User to
                the extent prepared without any contribution by Provider;&nbsp;
              </p>

              <p>
                c) allegation of facts that, if true, would constitute
                Customer's breach of any of its representations, warranties,
                covenants, or obligations under this Agreement; or
              </p>

              <p>
                d) negligence or more culpable act or omission (including
                recklessness or willful misconduct) by either party, any
                Authorized User, or any third party on behalf of Customer or any
                Authorized User, in connection with this Agreement.&nbsp;
              </p>
              
              
              
              <p>
                e) Notwithstanding the foregoing, Customer is not responsible
                and shall not be liable for the actions of, or content or
                Customer Data generated by End Users or any Authorized User
                other than its employees, contractors or service providers.
              </p>

              <p>
                11.3 Indemnification Procedure. Each party shall promptly notify
                the other party in writing of any Action for which such party
                believes it is entitled to be indemnified pursuant to Section
                11.1 or Section 11.2, as the case may be. The party seeking
                indemnification (the "Indemnitee") shall cooperate with the
                other party (the "Indemnitor") at the Indemnitor's sole cost and
                expense. The Indemnitor shall promptly assume control of the
                defense and shall employ counsel of its choice to handle and
                defend the same, at the Indemnitor's sole cost and expense. The
                Indemnitee may participate in and observe the proceedings at its
                own cost and expense with counsel of its own choosing. The
                Indemnitor shall not settle any Action on any terms or in any
                manner that adversely affects the rights of any Indemnitee
                without the Indemnitee's prior written consent , which shall not
                be unreasonably withheld or delayed. If the Indemnitor fails or
                refuses to assume control of the defense of such Action, the
                Indemnitee shall have the right, but no obligation, to defend
                against such Action, including settling such Action after giving
                notice to the Indemnitor, in each case in such manner and on
                such terms as the Indemnitee may deem appropriate. The
                Indemnitee's failure to perform any obligations under this
                Section 11.3 will not relieve the Indemnitor of its obligations
                under this Section 11, except to the extent that the Indemnitor
                can demonstrate that it has been materially prejudiced as a
                result of such failure.
              </p>

              <p>
                11.4 Mitigation. If any of the Services or Provider Materials
                are, or in Provider's opinion are likely to be, claimed to
                infringe, misappropriate, or otherwise violate any third-party
                Intellectual Property Right, or if Customer's or any Authorized
                User's use of the Services or Provider Materials is enjoined or
                threatened to be enjoined, Provider may, at its option and sole
                cost and expense:&nbsp;
              </p>

              <p>
                a) obtain the right for Customer to continue to use the Services
                and Provider Materials materially as contemplated by this
                Agreement;&nbsp;
              </p>
              
              
              <p>
                b) modify or replace the Services and Provider Materials, in
                whole or in part, to seek to make the Services and Provider
                Materials (as so modified or replaced) non-infringing, while
                providing materially equivalent features and functionality, in
                which case such modifications or replacements will constitute
                Services and Provider Materials, as applicable, under this
                Agreement; or&nbsp;
              </p>
              
              
              <p>
                c) by written notice to Customer, terminate this Agreement with
                respect to all of the Services and Provider Materials, and
                require Customer to immediately cease any use of the Services
                and Provider Materials, provided that if such termination occurs
                prior to one (1) year after the Effective Date, subject to
                Customer's compliance with its post-termination obligations set
                forth in Section 13.4, Customer will be entitled to a pro rata
                refund of all prepaid Fees.
              </p>

              <p>
                11.5 Sole Remedy. THIS SECTION 11 SETS FORTH CUSTOMER'S SOLE
                REMEDIES AND PROVIDER'S SOLE LIABILITY AND OBLIGATION FOR ANY
                ACTUAL, THREATENED, OR ALLEGED CLAIMS THAT THE SERVICES AND
                PROVIDER MATERIALS OR ANY SUBJECT MATTER OF THIS AGREEMENT
                INFRINGES, MISAPPROPRIATES, OR OTHERWISE VIOLATES ANY
                INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS OF ANY THIRD PARTY.&nbsp;
              </p>

              <p>12. Limitations of Liability.</p>

                PERSONS WERE ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSSES OR
                DAMAGES OR SUCH LOSSES OR DAMAGES WERE OTHERWISE FORESEEABLE,
                AND NOTWITHSTANDING THE FAILURE OF ANY AGREED OR OTHER REMEDY OF

              <p>

                PROVIDER AND ITS LICENSORS, SERVICE PROVIDERS, AND SUPPLIERS

                IF ANY REMEDY FAILS OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.&nbsp;

              <p>
                d) notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
                with respect to information and materials then in its possession

              </p>

              <p>

                not yet paid Fees, on receipt of Provider's invoice therefor;
                and
              </p>

                the then most recent version of Customer Data maintained by
                Provider, provided that Customer has at that time paid all Fees
                then outstanding and any amounts payable after or as a result of
                such expiration or termination, including in transferring such
                Customer Data.
              </p>

              <p>
                13.5 Surviving Terms. The provisions set forth in the following
                sections, and any other right or obligation of the parties in
                this Agreement that, by its nature, should survive termination
                or expiration of this Agreement, will survive any expiration or
                termination of this Agreement: Section 3.1, Section 8, Section
                10.4, Section 11, Section 12, Section 13.4, this Section 13.5,

                partnership, joint venture, or other form of joint enterprise,
                employment, or fiduciary relationship between the parties, and
                neither party shall have authority to contract for or bind the

                other party's trademarks, service marks, trade names, logos,
                domain names, or other indicia of source, association, or
                sponsorship, in each case, without the prior written consent of
                the other party, which consent shall not be unreasonably
                withheld; provided, however, Provider may include
                &nbsp;Customer's name and other indicia in its lists of
                Provider's current or former customers of Provider in
                promotional and marketing materials with written consent.

                or other communications under this Agreement have legal effect
                only if in writing and addressed to a party in the address set

                used in the plural, and vice-versa; and (e) words denoting any
                gender include all genders. Unless the context otherwise
                requires, references in this Agreement: (x) to sections,
                exhibits, schedules, attachments, and appendices mean the
                sections of, and exhibits, schedules, attachments, and

                drafting an instrument or causing any instrument to be drafted,
                with requested revisions. The exhibits, schedules, attachments,
                and appendices referred to herein are an integral part of this
                Agreement to the same extent as if they were set forth verbatim

                14.6 Headings. The headings in this Agreement are for reference
                only and do not affect the interpretation of this Agreement.
              </p>

              <p>
                14.7 Entire Agreement. This Agreement, together with Order
                Form(s) and any other documents incorporated herein by
                reference, constitutes the sole and entire agreement of the
                parties with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement and
                supersedes all prior and contemporaneous understandings,
                agreements, representations, and warranties, both written and
                oral, with respect to such subject matter. To the extent that
                the terms within the Order Form(s) conflict with or supplement
                the terms in this Agreement or any other documents incorporated
                herein by reference, the following order of precedence governs:
                (a) first, the Order Form(s); (b) second, this Agreement; and
                (c) third, any other documents incorporated herein by reference.

              <p>
                14.8 Mutual Assignment. Customer and Provider shall not assign
                or otherwise transfer any of its rights, or delegate or
                otherwise transfer any of its obligations or performance under
                this Agreement, in each case whether voluntarily, involuntarily,
                by operation of law, or otherwise, without Provider's prior
                written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably
                withheld, conditioned, or delayed. Notwithstanding the
                foregoing, any merger, consolidation, or reorganization
                involving either party &nbsp;(regardless of whether either party
                is a surviving or disappearing entity) will be not deemed to be
                a transfer of rights, obligations, or performance under this
                Agreement for which either party&rsquo;s prior written consent
                is required. No assignment, delegation, or transfer will relieve
                Customer of any of its obligations or performance under this
                Agreement. Any purported assignment, delegation, or transfer in
                violation of this Section 14.8 is void. This Agreement is
                binding upon and inures to the benefit of the parties hereto and
                their respective successors and permitted assigns.
              </p>

              <p>14.9 Force Majeure.</p>

              <p>
                a) No Breach or Default. In no event will Provider be liable or
                responsible to Customer, or be deemed to have defaulted under or
                breached this Agreement, for any failure or delay in fulfilling
                or performing any term of this Agreement, when and to the extent
                such failure or delay is caused by any circumstances beyond
                Provider's reasonable control (a "Force Majeure Event"),
                including acts of God, flood, fire, earthquake or explosion,
                war, terrorism, invasion, riot or other civil unrest, embargoes
                or blockades in effect on or after the date of this Agreement,
                national or regional emergency, strikes, labor stoppages or
                slowdowns or other industrial disturbances, passage of Law or
                any action taken by a governmental or public authority,
                including imposing an embargo, export or import restriction,
                quota, or other restriction or prohibition or any complete or
                partial government shutdown, or national or regional shortage of
                adequate power or telecommunications or transportation. Either
                party may terminate this Agreement if a Force Majeure Event
                continues substantially uninterrupted for a period of thirty
                (30) days or more.
              </p>

              <p>
                b) Affected Party Obligations. In the event of any failure or
                delay caused by a Force Majeure Event, Provider shall give
                prompt written notice to Customer stating the period of time the
                occurrence is expected to continue and use commercially
                reasonable efforts to end the failure or delay and minimize the
                effects of such Force Majeure Event.
              </p>

              <p>
                14.10 No Third-Party Beneficiaries. This Agreement is for the
                sole benefit of the parties hereto and their respective
                successors and permitted assigns and nothing herein, express or
                implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any other Person
                any legal or equitable right, benefit, or remedy of any nature
                whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement.
              </p>

              <p>
                14.11 Amendment and Modification; Waiver. No amendment to or
                modification of or rescission, termination, or discharge of this
                Agreement is effective unless it is in writing, identified as an
                amendment to or rescission, termination, or discharge of this
                Agreement and signed by an authorized representative of each
                party. No waiver by any party of any of the provisions hereof
                shall be effective unless explicitly set forth in writing and
                signed by the party so waiving. Except as otherwise set forth in
                this Agreement, no failure to exercise, or delay in exercising,
                any rights, remedy, power, or privilege arising from this
                Agreement will operate or be construed as a waiver thereof; nor
                shall any single or partial exercise of any right, remedy,
                power, or privilege hereunder preclude any other or further
                exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, remedy,
                power, or privilege.
              </p>

              <p>
                14.12 Severability. If any term or provision of this Agreement
                is invalid, illegal, or unenforceable in any jurisdiction, such
                invalidity, illegality, or unenforceability shall not affect any
                other term or provision of this Agreement or invalidate or
                render unenforceable such term or provision in any other
                jurisdiction. Upon such determination that any term or other
                provision is invalid, illegal, or unenforceable, the parties
                hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so
                as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as
                possible in a mutually acceptable manner in order that the
                transactions contemplated hereby be consummated as originally
                contemplated to the greatest extent possible.
              </p>

                14.13 Governing Law; Submission to Jurisdiction. This Agreement
                is governed by and construed in accordance with the internal
                laws of the State of Michigan without giving effect to any
                choice or conflict of law provision or rule that would require
                or permit the application of the laws of any jurisdiction other
                than those of the State of Michigan. Any legal suit, action, or
                proceeding arising out of or related to this Agreement or the
                licenses granted hereunder will be instituted exclusively in the
                federal courts of the United States or the courts of the State
                of Michigan in each case located in Oakland County, Michigan and
                each party irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of
                such courts in any such suit, action, or proceeding. Service of
                process, summons, notice, or other document by mail to such
                party's address set forth herein shall be effective service of
                process for any suit, action, or other proceeding brought in any
                such court.&nbsp;
              </p>

              <p>
                14.14 Waiver of Jury Trial. Each party irrevocably and
                unconditionally waives any right it may have to a trial by jury

                14.15 Equitable Relief. Each party acknowledges and agrees that
                a breach or threatened breach by such party of any of its
                obligations under Section 8 or, in the case of Customer, Section
                3.1 and Section 4.3, would cause the other party irreparable
                harm for which monetary damages would not be an adequate remedy
                and that, in the event of such breach or threatened breach, the
                other party will be entitled to equitable relief, including a
                restraining order, an injunction, specific performance, and any
                other relief that may be available from any court, without any
                requirement to post a bond or other security, or to prove actual
                damages or that monetary damages are not an adequate remedy.
                Such remedies are not exclusive and are in addition to all other
                remedies that may be available at law, in equity, or otherwise.

                14.16 Counterparts. The Order Forms may be executed in
                counterparts, each of which is deemed an original, but all of
                which together are deemed to be one and the same agreement. A
                signed copy of an Order Form delivered by facsimile, email, or
                other means of electronic transmission is deemed to have the
                same legal effect as delivery of an original signed copy of this
                Agreement.
